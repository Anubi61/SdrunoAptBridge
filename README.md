# SdrunoAptBridge
A bridge translator between APT Decoder and SDRUno CAT

I wrote this application in order to interface APT Decoder com port with SDRPlay SDRUno com port, and let APT Decoder change the vrx0 frequency to the approaching satellite.
The app works only with the NOAA 15,18 and 19 satellites, and is "coded" in vb.net 6.0. 
More information will be added to the readme file, later or may be never.
